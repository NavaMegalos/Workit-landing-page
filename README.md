### What I learned
``` 
First of all, I wanna say that this challenge was a good one for me because of the very little details that are behind the structure, like for example the border at the bottom of the first two sections or the position of the images in it... nevertheless I enjoyed the time spend in this challenge and I am very excited for acquire more knowledge about css and html in the new ones!
